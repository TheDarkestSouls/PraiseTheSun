## Work with tables
Tables aren't part of the core Markdown spec, but they are part of GFM and Markdown Here supports them. They are an easy way of adding tables to your email -- a task that would otherwise require copy-pasting from another application.

Colons can be used to align columns.

| I    | Am  | GitMaster  |
| -----|:---:| ----------:|
| can  | use | Markdown   |
| know | all | commands   |
| easy | as  | a pie      |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.
